"# What is `False` exactly? \n"
"\n"
"## How to prove `False` and what are the consequences? -- this has been introduced in the previous level...\n"
"This is what you did in the previous level. This section is just reiterating that point. \n"
"\n"
"Well, when was the first time you saw `False`?\n"
"\n"
"Here:\n"
"'\n"
"Negation of a proposition `P`, denoted `¬¨P`, is defined as `P ‚Üí False`. \n"
"'\n"
"It should be clear that to get to false, you would need to prove `¬¨P`, and `P`. Then given such a proof state:\n"
"```\n"
"hnP : ¬¨P\n"
"hP : P\n"
"```\n"
"we can obtain false by `hnP hP`.\n"
"Proving a proposition and its negation is a special case of 'deriving a contradiction' because we have proven `p ‚àß ¬¨p` which is always false. A logical system that has this quality is called an inconsistent system.\n"
"\n"
"## Principle of explosion\n"
"Moreover, `False` has no introduction rule , so the reasoning described above is the only way to obtain an object of type `False`. If you were able to find `h:False` i.e prove `False` then our system is worthless because we can prove anything. To reiterate, such a system would be called an inconsistent system because of a contradiction.\n"
"\n"
"-- rules of inference like modus ponens need to be emphasized to make this understsanble. Also we can make the user prove the principle of explosion using modus ponens.\n"
"will be discussed in previous, but the basic idea is that if you have in your proof state an `h` such that `h:False` then you can prove any proposition you want. In other words, within this proof state, all propositions are true. This is obviously absurd because it would mean for every proposition `p`, `p` is true and also `¬¨p` is true.\n"
"\n"
"So this is pretty good because now you can effortlessly prove anything you want!!!!! But this is also pretty bad because you can't really trust any of the results you obtain within an inconsistent system, can you?"

"# Truth Table\n"
"We want an operator which flips the value of a proposition `P`. Lets call this operator `Not` represented as `¬¨`. In other words, if `P` were true then `¬¨P` would be false and vice versa. \n"
"Note that `¬¨P` is also a proposition, so `¬¨ (¬¨P)` is a valid expression. Moreover, `¬¨ (¬¨P)` is a proposition so `¬¨ (¬¨ (¬¨P))` or `¬¨¬¨¬¨P` is a valid expression (and so on).\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"This is what the truth table would look like.\n"
"$$\n"

"\\hline\n"
"T & F  \\\\\n"
"F & T  \\\\\n"
"\\hline\n"

"Notice that this definition is an implication which you have learned to deal with in the previous level and that the truth table with `¬¨P` and the truth table with `P ‚Üí False` are identical which means that the implication definition captures what we want `¬¨` to mean.\n"
"\n"
"# Natural Language Example\n"
"Let `P` denote the assertion 'Today is Monday'. `¬¨P` would then denote the assertion 'Today is not Monday'. You could also say that `¬¨P` denotes 'Today is Tuesday or Wednsday or Thursday or Friday or Saturday or Sunday'. Both assertions express the same thing (assuming there are 7 days of the week and these are their names) so either one is acceptable.\n"
"\n"
"# Contradictions\n"
"Now we can construct propositional statements that are always false regardless of the values of their propositional variables. Having such a statement in your proof state would allow you to construct a term of type `False`. \n"
"\n"
"Such a statement is called a contradiction and is equal to `False` regardless of the proof state. Moreover, it is not something we assume to be true but something that is always true.\n"
"--------------------------------\n"
"# Defining `¬¨`\n"

"## But what is `False` exactly?(now we know what `False` is from the truth value perspective so this would need a rewrite in logic world, no it doesn't because we were dealing with `= False` but now we are dealing with `‚Üí False`).\n"
"For now, just know that `False` is a type that has no introduction rule and that proving `False` means deriving a contradiction. So, to prove `¬¨p` , you must assume `p` and derive a contradiction. We will explain in more detail what is meant by 'contradiction'.\n"

"We exploit the binary nature of an inhabitant. An inhabitant can be either/or. There are two options and no third, either a knight or a knave. So, we declare as variables a proposition for every inhabitant. Say we have three inhabitants A,B,C , we declare the following propositions:\n"
