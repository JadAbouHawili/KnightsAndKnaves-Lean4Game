advantages of current set theoretic formalization:
not do any weird things behind the scenes, show the logical and set theoretic expressions which the user would be used to by now.

using inductive types or sum types:
big disadvantage: goes against all the previous build up... remember that the game started with knights and knaves having set theoretic and logic formalization then backtracking...
- advantage: maybe as an interesting side project formalization

inductive Xor'' (P Q : Prop) : Prop
| introL (p : P) (np : ¬Q) 
| introR (q : Q) (nq : ¬P) 

  -- maybe do Knights and Knaves thing as inductive type...
