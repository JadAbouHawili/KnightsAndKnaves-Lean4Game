Good luck!

Statement {x : â„¤} (h : x + 2 = 4)
  : x = 2 := by {

  Template
    calc 
      x = x + 2 - 2 := by 
        Hint "hint here, works fine"
        Hole 
        ring
      _ = 4 - 2 := by Hole rw [h]
      _ = 2 := by Hole norm_num
  }
/-

    calc
      x = (x + 2) - 2:= by ring 
      _ = 4 - 2 := by rw [h]
      _ = 2 := by norm_num

Conclusion 
"
Notice that the pattern for this `calc` is rearrange variables, rewrite, rewrite. The next problem will have the same pattern in addition to requiring a calculation at the end.
