World "Simp_World"
Title "Simplification"
Introduction 
"
In the previous world, we introduced logical connectives and how to construct new propositions using them.

In this world, we have these expressions and some assumptions about their building blocks and we use this to simplify the expression.

For the first half of this world, all simplifications will be done manually after which the `simp` tactic is introduced. In the second half, you will redo those simplifications but now using the `simp` tactic.(which most if not all of the work)
