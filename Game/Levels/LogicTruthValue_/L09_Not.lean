Introduction

What this means is that we obtain `¬P` by assuming `P` and deriving a contradiction i.e constructing an object of type `False` i.e proving `False` which means that `False` is also true. 

`False` is the empty proposition, thus it has no introduction rule. It represents a contradiction.

What is a contradiction? Well, it is a propostional statement that is false for all possible values of its variables and deriving a contradiction means proving such a statement. By definition, `False` is always false. Another standard example of a contradiction is the following: 

$
\\begin{array}{|c|c|} 
\\hline
P & ¬P & P ∧ ¬P\\\\
\\hline
T & F & F \\\\
F & T & F \\\\
\\hline
\\end{array}
$

Another meaning for the term contradiction to refer to the assertion or proof of a propositional statement that is false for all possible values of its variables. We will use both interchangeably. So, deriving a contradiction means constructing such a proof.
