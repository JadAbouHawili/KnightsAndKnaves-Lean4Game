Introduction
"
In this level, we introduce the logical implication `→` connective.
Logical implication `P → Q` is made up of two components:
- The premise, which in this case is `P`
- The conclusion, which in this case is `Q`

`P → Q` is read as 'If `P` is true, then `Q` is true.
The truth of `P` IMPLIES the truth of `Q`. A proof of `P` IMPLIES a proof of `Q`.

A statement `P → Q` is false when `P` is true and `Q` false, it's true otherwise.
This is because this is the only case where the meaning of `P → Q` is violated i.e we have that `P` is true so `Q` is supposed to be true as well but its not.

When `P` is false, the implication `P → Q` is always false because the implication does not tell us what should happen when `P` is false.

In the current proof state, we know `P` (i.e `P` is true) , and we know `P → Q` (i.e `P → Q` is true). Therefore, we can conclude `Q` (i.e `Q` is true ).

You can think of logical implication as a function with one input and one output. It takes a proof of `P` and returns a proof of `Q`.

Conclusion 
"
In the next level, you will learn how to deal with an implication as the goal you have to prove.
"
-- This is what is called an inference rule. It has two assumptions, `p : P` , `ptoq : P → Q` and the conclusion `Q`. It is an inference rule because we 'infer' a certain conclusion from assumptions or already established theorems.
