- `simp`: This tactic simplifies expressions using a set of predefined rewrite rules. More specifically, the rules used are tagged with @[simp] in mathlib. It's especially useful for basic simplifications involving arithmetic, inequalities, and logical connectives.

- `ring`: This tactic is more powerful and is specifically designed for proving equalities in commutative rings. It automatically applies a variety of algebraic properties such as associativity, commutativity, and distributivity to simplify expressions. It's particularly handy when dealing with expressions involving addition and multiplication.
