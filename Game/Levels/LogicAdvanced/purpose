after Logic, some set theory lemmas are introduced for knights and knaves. However, if knights and knaves is reached and user is confused then go to LogicAdvanced to sharpen logic skills(can't teach anythign the user won't need, might just get more of the same stuff but the old stuff are limited, easy and this would get repetitive).
