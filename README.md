# Educational Theorem Prover Game
The following game offers a guided experience that teaches you the basics of proving theorems on a computer, specifically using the Lean theorem prover.

The final objective of the game is to teach you how to solve knights and knaves logic puzzles in a theorem prover. No pre-requisite knowledge of logic is needed or what the puzzle is, everything needed is slowly introduced in each world with plenty of hints and explanations.

## Worlds
The game is divided into the following worlds:
- Equational Reasoning
- Logic
- Knights and Knaves Lemmas
- Knights and Knaves
